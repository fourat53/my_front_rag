# AI Chat & PDF Viewer Frontend

## Overview
This project is a modern Next.js frontend application featuring an integrated AI chat interface and PDF document viewer. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and Framer Motion, it serves as the user-facing client for the AI Microservice backend, enabling Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and local LLM interactions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd my_front
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root of `my_front` (if needed) to configure frontend-specific variables.

## Usage

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
3. You can now interact with the chat interface and upload or view PDF documents. The application requires the backend microservice to be running to handle RAG and AI requests.
